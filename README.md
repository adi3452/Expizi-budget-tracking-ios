Definition of the App

We simply can’t live without our smartphones. We use them to email, shop, get directions… so why not install a budgeting app? Since we always have our smartphones with us, budget apps can be especially useful when it comes to keeping track of our expenses.

We think that financial management should be as simple as purchasing online. It should be done at any time, from any location, and with only a few mouse clicks. Expisure assists you in getting your money in order so that you don't have to worry about every dollar you spend. If you know how much and what you spend, it will be easier to adjust your financial habits if that is what you require.

Having a clear view of your money in one location makes it easier to manage them. Our objective here is to assist you in leaving your financial ghosts behind, overcoming your financial phobias, and instead of treating yourself with financial knowledge.

No matter what your day looks like, make sure that you will find time to work on developing your habit of tracking your expenses. In many cases, it is really only a question of a few minutes that can change your life in the long term and the way you plan to expenditure. Think about a time you spend commuting to work for example. Are you able to fit your habit into this time? Or what about a time before you go to sleep. Isn’t that a good time to reflect on your day and to evaluate how successful you were in building your portfolio? One of our users, for example, can be adding his transactions in bulk when the user is waiting in a queue while others are adding their transactions right after they purchased an item. It’s up to you to decide how do goanna track your outflows and incomes, but make sure to do it daily.

Why Is Budgeting Necessary?

It's critical to recognize that budgeting does not simply forego all of your favourite activities. A budget is simply intended to provide you with a clear picture of the money you have coming in each month and how much of it you are spending. This might help you better manage your weekly expenditures so you don't run out of money by the end of the month. Careful budgeting can also reveal costs that you may be able to reduce in order to save money for things that are truly essential to you
